### 3.2 Contingency Plans for High-Impact Risks

| Risk ID | Contingency Plan | Trigger Event | Resource Requirements |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| R1 | **Integration Complexity Contingency**<br>1. Reduce scope to focus on GitHub/Notion only for MVP<br>2. Allocate additional developer resources (up to 25% increase)<br>3. Extend Phase 2 timeline by up to 1 week<br>4. Consider alternative integration approaches | Integration completion <7 days behind schedule OR Multiple integration failures | Additional backend engineer time (10-15 hours/week), Potential budget increase of 5-10% |
| R2 | **Documentation Quality Contingency**<br>1. Implement enhanced data preprocessing pipeline<br>2. Focus on higher-quality sources first<br>3. Develop supplementary documentation for critical areas<br>4. Adjust accuracy expectations in affected domains | Data quality assessment shows >30% of content insufficient OR Test queries show <60% accuracy | Documentation team time (20-30 hours total), Potential process changes for documentation |
| R3 | **Response Quality Contingency**<br>1. Implement more aggressive retrieval augmentation<br>2. Adjust prompt engineering approach<br>3. Consider alternative LLM provider for specific domains<br>4. Develop domain-specific enhancement modules | Accuracy testing shows <70% correct responses OR User feedback indicates quality issues | Additional engineering time (20-30 hours), Potential additional API costs (5-10% increase) |
| R6 | **Adoption Contingency**<br>1. Conduct focused user interviews to identify barriers<br>2. Develop targeted training for specific user groups<br>3. Implement gamification elements to encourage usage<br>4. Create compelling use cases with measurable benefits | <50% adoption after 2 weeks OR Negative feedback from early users | Additional training resources, Marketing materials, Executive sponsor time |
| R7 | **Timeline Contingency**<br>1. Reduce scope to core MVP features<br>2. Extend timeline for non-critical features<br>3. Increase resource allocation temporarily<br>4. Implement parallel work streams where possible | Critical path slipping by >3 days OR Multiple deliver
