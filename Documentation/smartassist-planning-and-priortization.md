## PART 1: PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

### 1.1 Scoring Criteria & Methodology

#### Business Value Criteria (Weight: 60%)

| Criteria | Weight | Description | Scoring (1-5) |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Knowledge Retrieval Impact | 25% | Effect on reducing time spent searching for information | 1: Minimal impact, 5: Significant time reduction |
| Onboarding Efficiency | 20% | Contribution to reducing new hire onboarding time | 1: Minimal improvement, 5: Dramatically reduces onboarding time |
| Question Accuracy | 20% | Contribution to achieving 80% accuracy in responses | 1: Low accuracy, 5: High accuracy |
| User Adoption Potential | 15% | Likelihood of feature driving user adoption | 1: Low adoption potential, 5: High adoption potential |
| Reduction in Repeated Questions | 10% | Impact on reducing repetitive questions to senior staff | 1: Minimal reduction, 5: Significant reduction |
| Strategic Alignment | 10% | Alignment with company growth and scaling strategy | 1: Low alignment, 5: Perfect alignment |

#### Implementation Complexity Criteria (Weight: 40%)

| Criteria | Weight | Description | Scoring (1-5) |
|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Technical Complexity | 30% | Difficulty of technical implementation | 1: Simple, 5: Highly complex |
| Integration Difficulty | 25% | Complexity of integrating with existing systems | 1: Easy integration, 5: Difficult integration |

#### Formula for Prioritization Score:

> Priority Score = (Business Value Score × 0.60) - (Complexity Score × 0.40)

Features will be ranked from highest to lowest priority score.

### 1.2 Decision-Making Process

#### Prioritization Meeting Structure

Weekly prioritization meetings will be held every Friday from 10:00-11:30 AM, led by Maya Patel (Head of Engineering). Attendees will include Alex Rivera (CTO), Jamal Williams (Operations Manager), and the Lead Developer.

The meeting will follow this structure:
1. Review of previous week's progress (15 minutes)
2. Feature scoring based on prioritization framework (30 minutes)
3. Discussion of dependencies and technical constraints (20 minutes)
4. Finalization of next sprint priorities (20 minutes)
5. Action items and decisions documentation (5 minutes)

#### Conflict Resolution Protocol

1. Clear articulation of conflicting viewpoints with supporting data
2. Evaluation against project objectives and success criteria
3. Impact assessment on timeline, resources, and project goals
4. Decision hierarchy:
   - Technical conflicts: Resolved by Alex Rivera (CTO)
   - Business priority conflicts: Resolved by Maya Patel (Head of Engineering)
   - Strategic conflicts: Escalated to Sarah Chen (CEO)

#### Re-Prioritization Triggers

The project priorities will be re-evaluated when:
- New critical business requirements emerge
- Technical blockers are discovered that affect the critical path
- Resource availability changes significantly
- Data quality or integration issues are more severe than anticipated
- User feedback from alpha/beta testing suggests different priorities
- Timeline constraints require scope adjustment
