# SmartAssist Project Scope Document

## 1. Executive Summary

SmartAssist is an internal LLM solution designed to address TechNova's growing knowledge management challenges as they scale from 15 to 30+ employees. The project will implement a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that centralizes knowledge across GitHub, Notion, Slack, and Google Drive, reducing information silos and improving productivity. Currently, TechNova's team spends approximately 30% of their time searching for information or answering repetitive questions, creating a significant productivity loss.

The solution will be implemented over a 3-month period (May 15 - August 15, 2025) with a budget of $20,000-$25,000. The primary objectives include reducing search time by 50%, decreasing onboarding time from 4 to 2 weeks, and achieving 80% accuracy in answering internal questions. By addressing these challenges, SmartAssist is expected to increase engineering capacity for billable work by 15% and significantly improve knowledge retention as the company scales.

## 2. Project Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Business Objectives

SmartAssist aims to create a customized LLM solution that centralizes TechNova's company knowledge, automates repetitive tasks, and provides intelligent assistance to team members. The solution will address knowledge silos, reduce time spent searching for information, improve documentation quality, and enhance onboarding efficiency.

### 2.2 SMART Goals

1. **Specific**: Build a secure, private RAG-based LLM application that integrates with GitHub, Notion, Slack, and Google Drive to provide accurate information retrieval and assistance.
2. **Measurable**: Reduce information search time by 50%, achieve 80% accuracy in answering internal questions, and decrease onboarding time from 4 to 2 weeks.
3. **Achievable**: Implement the solution within a 3-month timeframe using a combination of existing LLM technologies and custom development.
4. **Relevant**: Directly addresses the identified business problems of knowledge silos, time waste, and inconsistent documentation.
5. **Time-bound**: Complete full implementation by August 15, 2025, with specific milestones throughout the project timeline.

### 2.3 Success Criteria and KPIs

- 50% reduction in time spent searching for information across systems
- Reduction in new employee onboarding time from 4 weeks to 2 weeks
- 80% accuracy in answering internal questions
- 90% employee adoption within 2 months of launch
- 40% reduction in repeated questions to senior team members
- Response latency under 3 seconds
- Positive satisfaction scores (>4.2/5) from user feedback

## 3. Project Justification

### 3.1 Business Case Summary

TechNova is experiencing inefficiencies as they grow, with team members spending approximately 30% of their time searching for information across multiple systems or answering repetitive questions. This creates knowledge silos, inconsistent documentation, and extended onboarding times for new hires. SmartAssist will implement a RAG-based LLM solution to centralize knowledge access, improve information retrieval, and automate repetitive tasks.

### 3.2 Expected Benefits

**Quantitative Benefits:**

- 15% increase in engineering capacity for billable work
- 50% reduction in time spent searching for information
- 50% reduction in onboarding time (from 4 weeks to 2 weeks)
- 40% reduction in repeated questions to senior team members
- Enabling self-service for 70% of common internal questions

**Qualitative Benefits:**

- Improved employee satisfaction and reduced frustration
- Better knowledge retention as the company scales
- Improved code documentation quality and consistency
- Faster response times to client inquiries
- Creation of a foundation for potential future client-facing AI assistance

### 3.3 Strategic Alignment

SmartAssist aligns with TechNova's growth strategy as they scale from 15 to 30+ employees. The project directly supports organizational efficiency by:

- Addressing knowledge silos that form as the team grows
- Enabling faster onboarding for new hires planned for September 2025
- Creating a centralized knowledge system that scales with the company
- Establishing a foundation for potential client-facing AI assistance in the future
- Supporting the company's need to maintain quality while scaling operations

### 3.4 ROI Projections

Based on the investment of $20,000-$25,000 for implementation and approximately $650/month in ongoing costs:

- **Cost-benefit analysis**: With a team of 15 employees spending 30% of their time on inefficient knowledge work, and assuming an average fully-loaded cost of $100,000 per employee, the current inefficiency costs approximately $450,000 annually (15 × $100,000 × 0.3). A 50% reduction in this inefficiency would save $225,000 annually.
- **Expected return timeframe**: The project is expected to pay for itself within 1-2 months after full implementation.
- **Financial metrics**: With a $25,000 investment and $225,000 annual savings, the ROI is approximately 800% in the first year, excluding ongoing costs.
